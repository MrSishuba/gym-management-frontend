            <p>Leadership is not just about giving orders; it's about inspiring and motivating your team to achieve their best.</p>
          
            <div *ngIf="showMore1">
                <p>Great leaders focus on nurturing the talent within their team. They strive to build strong, trusting relationships and provide clear guidance.</p>
                <p>It's also essential to lead by example, demonstrating the qualities you expect from your team members. Transparency and effective communication are key.</p>
                <p>Moreover, recognizing and rewarding effort creates an environment where individuals feel valued and motivated to contribute their best.</p>
                <p>Leadership is not about power, but responsibility. It's about empowering others and sharing your vision for collective success.</p>
                <p>Finally, a true leader remains humble and open to feedback, always seeking ways to improve both themselves and the team.</p>

            <h3>The True Meaning of Strength</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/Gym43.jpg" alt="Strength">

                <p>Physical strength is just one aspect of overall fitness. Mental resilience is what helps you push through tough challenges.</p> 
                <p>Strength also comes from emotional stability, being able to remain grounded even in difficult times.</p> 
                <p>True fitness is a balance of the mind, body, and soul, where mental clarity and emotional health are just as important as physical endurance.</p>
